Observation! A Number Counting Game App

When a user clicks a number, if it is the next number in order, then its background turns a different color for the remainder. If it is the wrong number, nothing happens. Once all numbers have been clicked in order, a win message displayes with the text “You Win!”.

The “Start!” button defaults to starting a game containing 25 numbers and will shuffle the numbers as well as restart a game in progress when clicked.

No installation required; simply open the browser page provided. Have fun!
