Observation!
A Number Counting Game App

When a user clicks a number, if it is the next number in order, then its background turns a different color for the remainder. If it is the wrong number, nothing happens
Once all numbers have been clicked in order, a win message displayes with the text “You Win!”.

Hitting the “Start!” button defaults to starting a game containing 25 numbers and clicking the start button on subsequent clicks defaults to starting a game containing 25 numbers and will shuffle the numbers and restart the game. No other buttons to start a game are allowed.
