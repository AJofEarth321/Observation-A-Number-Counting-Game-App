Observation Exercise
JavaScript Observation Test Exercise v1
Background:
The nature tour company, Animal Spotters, is hiring tour guides. They have found that their best guides are easily able to spot animals from a distance. They want applicants to take an observational test that will eventually be used to pre-rank applicants prior to any interviews. Applicants will see a screen filled with numbers. Their job is to click the numbers in order from 1 to the max. Animal Spotters has asked you to build out a proof of concept for this screening tool.

Requirements:

App uses JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
The page displays a grid of buttons containing numbers from 1-25
Numbers have a randomized order
When a user clicks a number, if it is the next number in order, then its background turns a different color for the remainder. If it is the wrong number, nothing happens
Once all numbers have been clicked in order, a win message displayes with the text “You Win!”.
Hitting the “Start!” button defaults to starting a game containing 25 numbers and clicking the start button on subsequent clicks defaults to starting a game containing 25 numbers and will shuffle the numbers and restart the game. No other buttons to start a game are allowed.
